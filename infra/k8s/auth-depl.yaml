# Whenever you create a deployment, you usually also want to create a cluster IP Service (which is a Kubernetes service),
# in order to give you access to a pod.
# A cluster IP service is going to allow communication to that cluster IP service from anything else running (only) inside of our cluster.
# To colocate  the cluster IP config in the same file as the deployment config file, you can do that via the
# three dashes separator. (You could also create a separate file for it, but often there will be a 1:1 ratio between our
# deployments and our (cluster IP) services, so it kind of makes sense to put everything into one file.)
